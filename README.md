## Getting and Cleaning Data by Johns Hopkins in Coursera
## PROJECT
## README FILE

Author: Michael Xenakis <br />

Original Data Location: [UC Irvine Repository](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip "Clicking will download the data")

CodeBook: [CodeBook File](XXXXXXX)

## Project Requirements
Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

- [x] Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- [x] Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- [x] Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
- [x] Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- [x] From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Requirements
The aim is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.You will be required to submit:

1. a tidy data set as described below

2. a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis

3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

4. a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
